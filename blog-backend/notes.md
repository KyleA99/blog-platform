Project Overview
The project involves building a simple blog platform using the following technologies:

Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript
Backend: Laravel Lumen
Database: MySQL
API Documentation: Zircote Swagger

Goals
Develop a responsive and interactive user interface with Vanilla JavaScript.
Implement a robust backend API using Laravel Lumen and Query Builder.
Design and manage a relational database with MySQL.
Document the API endpoints using Zircote Swagger for better clarity and maintenance.

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Setting Up the Development Environment
Frontend: Set up a basic HTML structure and include Vanilla JavaScript files.
Backend: Install Laravel Lumen and configure it for your project.
Database: Install MySQL and set up a new database for the blog.
2. Frontend Development
HTML/CSS: Design a simple and clean layout for the blog platform. Include pages for:
Home (listing all blog posts)
Single post view
Create/edit post
JavaScript:
Fetch and display blog posts from the backend.
Handle user interactions such as form submissions for creating and editing posts.
3. Backend Development
Routing: Set up routes for the API endpoints using Laravel Lumen.
GET /posts: Fetch all posts
GET /posts/{id}: Fetch a single post by ID
POST /posts: Create a new post
PUT /posts/{id}: Update an existing post
DELETE /posts/{id}: Delete a post
Controllers: Implement controller methods to handle the logic for each endpoint using Laravel Query Builder for database operations.
Query Builder: Use Laravel’s Query Builder to interact with the MySQL database instead of Eloquent models.
4. Database Design
Design the database schema for the blog platform. A simple schema could include:
posts table: id, title, content, author, created_at, updated_at.
Use Laravel Migrations to create and manage the database tables.
5. API Documentation with Zircote Swagger
Set up Zircote Swagger in the Laravel Lumen project.
Document each API endpoint, including request parameters and response formats.
Generate and serve the API documentation for easy access.
6. Connecting Frontend and Backend
Use JavaScript’s fetch API to interact with the backend endpoints.
Handle responses and update the UI accordingly.
7. Testing and Deployment
Testing: Write unit tests for the backend using PHPUnit. Test the API endpoints to ensure they work as expected.
Deployment: Deploy the application to a web server. Ensure the frontend and backend are properly connected in the production environment.

Features
User-friendly Interface: A clean and responsive UI for users to read, create, and manage blog posts.
CRUD Operations: Full functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts.
API Documentation: Comprehensive documentation for the API endpoints using Zircote Swagger to facilitate future development and maintenance.

Conclusion
By following this guide, you’ll develop a comprehensive understanding of full-stack development, including frontend and backend integration, database management using Query Builder, and API documentation with Zircote Swagger. This project will enhance your coding skills and provide a tangible product to showcase in your portfolio.
